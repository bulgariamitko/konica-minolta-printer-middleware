Overview

    Build a middleware framework to connect your Konica Minolta printers (4 machines with different UIs/firmwares)
     to your file and order management platform.

    Key Findings from Research

    Device Capabilities (KM C654e at 192.168.1.200)

    - Web Interface: Custom /wcd/ framework with XML/JavaScript backend
    - Authentication: Cookie-based sessions, admin password: 1234567812345678
    - Protocols: HTTP web interface, SNMP monitoring, IPP on port 631, direct print on port 9100
    - Architecture: No REST API - uses proprietary XML/XSLT transformation system

    Integration Approaches from GitHub Analysis

    1. PyKonica: Python device control framework (minimal but structured)
    2. KMEF: Lightweight CGI framework using JSON for remote services
    3. Various tools: SNMP management, PowerShell scripting, direct device protocols

    Implementation Plan

    Phase 1: Core Middleware Architecture

    1. API Layer: RESTful interface for your platform to submit print jobs
    2. Device Manager: Handle multiple machine types and firmware versions
    3. Authentication Module: Manage device-specific login mechanisms
    4. Job Queue: Queue and track print jobs across all 4 machines

    Phase 2: Printer Communication Modules

    1. HTTP/Web Interface Module: Handle KM web-based interfaces (/wcd/ endpoints)
    2. IPP Module: Standard Internet Printing Protocol for compatible functions
    3. SNMP Module: Device monitoring and status reporting
    4. Direct Print Module: Port 9100 for raw PCL/PostScript submission

    Phase 3: Print Job Processing

    1. File Handler: Process different file types (PDF, images, documents)
    2. Settings Manager: Handle print settings (color, duplex, paper size, quality)
    3. Job Tracker: Monitor job status and completion
    4. Error Handler: Manage failures and retry logic

    Phase 4: Multi-Device Support

    1. Device Discovery: Auto-detect available machines on network
    2. Capability Detection: Determine each machine's features and limitations
    3. Load Balancing: Distribute jobs based on machine availability and capabilities
    4. Unified Interface: Single API regardless of underlying machine differences

    Technical Stack Recommendation

    - Language: Python (good library support for printing protocols)
    - Framework: FastAPI for RESTful middleware API
    - Libraries: cups-python, snmp, requests, asyncio for concurrent operations
    - Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL for job tracking and device management

    Deliverables

    1. Middleware API Server: Central service handling print requests
    2. Device Adapters: Specific modules for each machine type/firmware
    3. Configuration System: Easy setup for new machines and settings
    4. Monitoring Dashboard: Job status and machine health overview
    5. Integration SDK: Simple interface for your platform to submit jobs

    This plan provides a robust foundation for connecting all 4 Konica Minolta machines through a unified
    middleware layer, abstracting the complexity of different UIs and firmwares.
